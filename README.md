Showing my little knowledge I have in programming with my mini projects

I created this repo to show those getting started in programming the 
value of creating programs even if you feel you've got a lot 
to learn.

Programs in this repository were created using my android
phone.

I know I have a lot to improve on. That's why I 
decided to make my codes publicly so that if you're 
interested in helping me improve my code quality, you
can do so easily.
